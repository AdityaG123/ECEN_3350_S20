Some C code:
int main(){
	int i = 0;
	int N = 6;
	int X[] = {5, 3, -6, 19, 8, 12};
	int Y[] = {0,0,0,0,0,0};
	int r5 = 0;
	while (N>0){
		Y[i] = X[i];
		i++;
		N = N - 1;
	}
	return;
}


Explanation of the C code:
The code above is showing that the the array X and Y are assigned in the code to register r2 and register r3. 
The array value N is the length of the arrays which is set to the resgister r4. The first value in the X array that is getting pointed to,
moves to the address of the pointer in array Y. This process keeps happening as the code moves down the array until it reaches the end meaning 
that the values have been copied from the X array to the Y array. Then the results are outputted.
